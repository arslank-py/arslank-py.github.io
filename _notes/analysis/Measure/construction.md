## Measures

<div class='definition' name='Countably additive'>
Let $X$ be a set, and let $\AA$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$. A function $\mu:\AA\to [0,+\infty] $ is said to be countably additive if it satisfies
\[
\mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(A_i),
\]
for each infinite sequence $\{A_i\}$ of disjoint sets that belong to $\AA$. 
</div>

<div class='definition' name='Measure'>
A measure (or countably additive measure) on $\AA$ is a function $\mu:\AA\to[0,+\infty] $ that satisfies
<ol type="a">
    <li>$\mu(\emptyset)=0$ ,</li>
    <li>countably additive.</li>
</ol>
</div>

The finite analogue of both definitions hold, where $\AA$ is an algebra and $\mu:\AA\to[0,+\infty]$ is finitely additive and satsfies $\mu(\emptyset)=0$ . In fact, every countably additive measure is finitely additive (let $A_i=\emptyset $ for $ i>n$). 

We are now ready to define one of the primary building blocks in Measure Theory, providing the structure needed to work with integration to probability to analysis of functions. 

<div class='definition' name='Measure space'>
If $X$ is a set, $\AA$ a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$, and $\mu$ a measure on $\AA$, then the triplet $(X,\AA,\mu) $ is called a measure space. Likewise, if $X$ is a set and $\AA$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$, then the pair $(X,\AA) $ is called a measurable space. If $(X,\AA,\mu) $ is a measure space, then we say $\mu$ is a measure on $(X,\AA) $. 
</div>

#### Examples:

<ol>
    <li>Let $X$ be an arbitray set, and let $\AA$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$. Define a function $\mu:\AA\to[0,+\infty]$ by letting $\mu(A)=n $ if $A$ is a finite set with $n$ elements and letting $\mu(A)=+\infty $ if $A$ is an infinite set. Then $\mu$ is a measure; referred to as the counting measure on $(X,\AA)$ .</li>
    <li>Let $X$ be a nonempty set, and let $\AA$ be a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$. Let $x\in X$ and define a function $\delta_x:\AA\to[0,+\infty] $ by letting $\delta_x(A)=1 $ if $x\in A $ and $\delta_x(A)=0 $ if $x\notin A$ . Then $\delta_x$ is a measure; referred to as a point mass or dirac measure concentrated at $x$.</li>
</ol>

<div class='proposition' name='Monotonicity of measures'>
Let $(X,\AA,\mu) $ be a measure space and let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of $X$ such that $A,B\in\AA$ and satisfy $A\subseteq B$. Then $\mu(A)\leq \mu(B)$ . If in addition $A$ satisfies $\mu(A)<+\infty$ , then $\mu(B-A)=\mu(B)-\mu(A)$ . 
</div>

<details class='proof'>
<summary>Proof.</summary>
The sets $A$ and $B-A$ are disjoint and satisfy $B=A\cup (B-A)$ ; thus the additivity of $\mu$ implies that
\[
\mu(B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B-A).
\]
Since $\mu(B-A)\geq 0$ , it follows that $\mu(A)\leq \mu(B)$ . If $\mu(A)<+\infty$ , the relation $\mu(B-A)=\mu(B)-\mu(A) $ also follows. 
</details>

We now provide two ways of characterizing measures and their respective spaces by how the handle the "total" measure of the space $X$. 

<div class='definition' name='Finite measure'>
Let $\mu$ be a measure on a measurable space $(X,\AA)$. Then $\mu$ is finite if it satisfies $\mu(X)<+\infty$ . By the monotonicity of measures, this implies
\[
\mu(A)<+\infty \quad\text{for all}\quad A\in\AA.
\]
</div>

Finite measure possess a number of attractive properties that allow their handling to be much easier to work with than more general measures. The most familiar family of finite measures are probability measures. 

<div class='definition' name='Ïƒ-Finite measure'>
Let $\mu$ be a measure on a measurable space $(X,\AA)$. The measure $\mu$ is called $\sigma$-finite if the set $X$ can be covered with at most countably many measurable sets with finite measure. That is, there exists $\{A_i\}\in\AA$ such that $\mu(A_i)<+\infty $  and
\[
X=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \quad\text{for all}\quad i\in\N.   
\]

<br><br>
More generally, a set $A\in\AA$ is $\sigma$-finite under $\mu$ if it is the countable union of a sequence of sets that belong to $\AA$ and have finite measure under $\mu$. 
</div>

$\sigma$-finite measures generalize finite measures and allows for spaces with potentially infinite measure to be decomposed into countably many subsets with finite measure. This allows the application of techniques of finite-measure to be extended to infinite-measure problems. 

**Note:** If the measure space $(X,\AA,\mu) $  is $\sigma$-finite, then $X$ is the union of a sequence $$\{B_i\}$$ of disjoint sets that belong to $\AA$ and have finite measure under $\mu$; this alternative disjoint sequence $$\{B_i\}$$ can be formed by choosing a sequence $$\{A_i\}$$ as in the definition of $\sigma$-finiteness, and then letting
\\[
B_1=A_1, \quad\text{and}\quad B_i=A_i-\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{i-1} A_j\right) \quad\text{if}\quad i>1. 
\\] 

The measure space $(X,\AA,\mu) $  is also called finite or $\sigma$-finite if $\mu$ is finite or $\sigma$-finite.
